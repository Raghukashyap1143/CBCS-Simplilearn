You can think of regular expressions as amplified wildcards. You are familiar with wildcard notations such as `*.txt` to find all text files in a file manager. The regex equivalent is `.*\\.txt`.\n","\n","\n","## Why Do We Need Regular Expressions?\n","\n","In the last few lessons, we spent a lot of time parsing logs. Many of the logs had a fixed structure with each column having a value. This is not always the case! In some logs, each line will be a completely different structure. If we are looking for lines in a file that have specific information like IP's, domain names, or emails, we can look for the pattern inside those files and only parse the logs that are of interest to us.\n","\n","The module we can use is called `re`. If we want to look for any string that ends with a `txt` extension, we can use `match = re/search(pattern,string)`. We are using `search` to look for a pattern. `match` will return:\n","* `true` if a pattern is found\n","* `false` if a pattern is not found"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":0,"id":"0108da10","metadata":{"cellIdentifier":"bhg2pe1w6gmrxwdos9ara"},"outputs":[],"source":["import re \n","string = \"2.txt\"\n","match = re.search(\".*\\.txt\", string)\n","if match:\n","    print(\"pattern found\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"pattern is not found\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6216ddb3","metadata":{"cellIdentifier":"l5hirli2yzrmpved6fq8c"},"source":["## Explanation\n","In RegEx (in any language including Bash) a `.` stands for any characters.
