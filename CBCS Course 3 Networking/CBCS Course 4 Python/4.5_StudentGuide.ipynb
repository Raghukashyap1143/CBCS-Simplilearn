    "\n",
    "While built-in functions are useful, programmers create specific functions for various use cases. These are commonly referred to as user-defined functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the following program to define the terms used in functions.\n",

    "```\n",
    "def function_name(parameters):\n",

    "\n",
    "* Parameters (arguments) through which we pass values to a function. They are optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A colon, `:`,  to mark the end of the function header.\n",
    "\n",
    "* One or more valid Python statements that make up the function body. Statements must have the same indentation level.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An optional `return` statement to return a value from the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at an example of a simple function that does not contain a parameter. \n",
    "A function can be written without having  an input nor an output (with a `return` statement). It only prints the specific strings indicated in the function body. "
