    "The easiest way to open a file is using the `open` method, which is built-in in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "`file_name = ”/voc/public/passwd”`\n",
    "\n",
    "`open_file = open(file_name)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have opened the file, the object will have a a few methods available. Here are some useful ones:\n",
    "* ```close()```\tCloses the file\n",
    "* ```read()```\tReturns the file content\n",
    "* ```readline()```\tReturns one line from the file\n",
    "* ```readlines()```\tReturns a list of lines from the file\n",
    "* ```seek()```\tChange the file position\n",
    "* ```tell()```\tReturns the current file position\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the `open` method. The command is:\n",
    "`file_name=open('file_name',mode)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are descriptions of all the modes:\n",
    "* ```r```: Opens a file for reading.\n",
    "* ```w```: Opens a file for writing. Creates a new file if it does not exist or truncates the file if it exists.\n",
    "* ```x```: Opens a file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, the operation fails.\n",
    "* ```a```: Opens a file for appending at the end of the file without truncating it. Creates a new file if it does not exist.\n",
    "* ```t```: Opens in text mode.\n",
    "* ```b```: Opens in binary mode.\n",
    "* ```+```: Opens a file for updating.\n"
